### Howdy ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Javascript enthusiast whose first love is mathematics. 
I've been programming since I was 9 years old and probably will continue to do so as long as I am able to use a keyboard!

I am from Ohio, but I am currently in Texas, where I am studying at Coastal Bend College to be a genuine Computer Scientist.
